## How to start

- npm install
- npm start
- npm test

- validation on frontend js. Didn't use validation in mongoose schema.
- testing only mongoose schema data with mocha. 

- PS. first time react + mocha.


## Task

Please create a small application form for an event. The form should contain fields listed below:
- First name (required)
- Last name (required)
- Email (required, valid email address)
- Event date (required, simple date picker)

Our requirements:
- Frontend should be written in React (using Redux will be very appreciated)
- Data from form should be saved in DB (we suggest MongoDB)
- Data from form should be validated before saving
- Errors should be handled and displayed for the user
- App should be tested (It's your decision what kind of tests are necessary)
